  aboutMe:
    "Hi I’m Nathan, I'm a versatile software developer with a strong background in both technical \
    support and retail management. Equipped with a Computer Programming diploma and hands-on experience \
    in various programming languages, I excel in web development, software design, and systems \
    administration. My leadership experience as a Retail Supervisor has refined my problem-solving, \
    teamwork, and communication skills. Skilled in software development, systems administration, and \
    network security, I combine technical expertise with strong interpersonal skills to deliver effective, \
    user-focused solutions. I’m passionate about leveraging my diverse expertise to develop innovative \
    solutions and contribute to dynamic tech teams.",

      description:
        "The idea for this project came from the common problem of having a few ingredients on hand but \
        not knowing what to cook. I wanted to create a program where you could simply enter the ingredients \
        you have, and it would suggest a variety of recipes you can make with them.",
      reflection:
        "After developing this program and reflecting on it, I realized that adding a filtering \
        system for the recipe results would be a valuable improvement. For example, sorting recipes by average \
        user reviews could help prioritize higher quality options. Additionally, it would be useful to ensure \
        that the suggested recipes closely match the user's provided ingredients. Ideally, most of the listed \
        ingredients should appear in each recipe. I’d also like to implement error handling, such as checking \
        for invalid or misspelled inputs, to make the program more reliable and user-friendly.",

        "This fun project was built to explore patterns in lottery numbers. The bot scrapes winning combinations \
        from 2009 to present, analyzes the most common number in each position, and generates a 'likely' set of \
        numbers based on historical trends. Built to experiment with web scraping, data analysis, and bot logic.",
      reflection:
      "If I were to recreate this project, I would modify the logic to identify the top 3 most frequent numbers \
      per position rather than just the most common one. This would generate more diverse combinations and \
      potentially increase the odds of hitting a winning number. It would also make the predictions feel less \
      repetitive and more engaging for users.",

      name: "Wordle Solver",
      description:
        "During the Wordle craze, I developed a program to assist with solving the puzzle more efficiently. \
        The program suggests possible words based on user feedback for each guess. You simply input whether \
        each letter is correct, in the wrong position, or not in the word at all. Using this feedback, the \
        program intelligently narrows down the list of possible words until it finds the solution.",
      reflection:
        "Looking back on the application, I believe incorporating image recognition would be a \
        major enhancement. Automating the process by having AI enter guesses directly into the Wordle \
        interface and visually interpret the feedback (e.g., identifying correct letters, misplaced \
        letters, or incorrect ones) would remove the need for manual input and create a more seamless \
        solving experience.",

      description:
        "This project was developed as part of my college coursework. The web page displays an interactive \
         map showing flights originating from Canada. Each flight is represented by an icon that points in \
         the direction of travel. Clicking on a flight icon opens a popup with detailed flight information.",
      reflection:
      "This project is now three years old. Upon revisiting it, I discovered an issue with the flight data \
      API, each IP address is limited to a set number of requests, and exceeding this limit causes the \
      application to stop functioning. This limitation wasn’t encountered during the initial build. Replacing \
      the current API with one that offers higher or unlimited requests would greatly improve reliability. \
      Additionally, implementing a sorting feature to dynamically filter flights by location would enhance \
      usability.",

        Discord, making it easy to stay connected and entertained. The bot was self hosted using a headless \
        RaspberryPi.",
      reflection:
      "The bot included all basic CRUD functionality except for Update. Adding this feature would enhance the \
      user experience by allowing edits to existing entries. Movie data was stored in a plain text file, with \
      each movie on a separate line and read into the application via Python. Migrating to a database solution \
      like SQLite would improve data handling, scalability, and reliability.",
